# JetsProject

# Description 
In this project we were asked to create a number of different items for a program. These included, reading data from a text file and displaying it, adding and removing objects to an ArrayList, and identifying different qualities of the objects and displaying them accordingly. We had to create several classes and extend from one parent class to a sub-class in conjunction with identifying when to use an Abstract modifier in a class or method. 

# technologies used
Eclipse, git, github. 

# lessons learned
I learned a lot during this project, specifically how to read data from a text file and display it. I conducted a trial and error approach on several aspects of this program attempting to get classes and methods to link up correctly so the proper information could be called and displayed.
